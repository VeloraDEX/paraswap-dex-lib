# Questions

In summary, we are GMX.io clone. Our core functions and system workflow almost identical. We follow the same structure as GMX did.

- We followed the same test structure how GMX done before. Is there anything to consider different from GMX for us?

- For the Adapters in config.ts file, Which aggregator should we use for Polygon? I thing there should be another aggregator for us, if its correct, who is going to deploy the new aggregator?

- How can we test the e2e integration without using aggregator (aggregator that Metavault.Trade swap enabled,not exist yet)
